# Aaram Font

Aaram is a unique typeface with pizzazz and also got the geometric & neutral appearences. This font supports Tamil and Latin. Primarily designed for the screen usage but it'll make the print, awesome too. Slightly condensed design of Aaram makes it particularly effective for space economizing. It has been conceived to be most suitable for all types of texts blocks and headings. Aaram is highly legible and quite versatile and it performs nicely in small sizes.

**Fun Fact:** Shape of this font, derived from the different radius in a circle & curves in a rectangle, thus Aaram is a [Tamil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) word, which litereally means radius.
